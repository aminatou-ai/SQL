Welcome to my SQL portfolio! ðŸŽ“

I am enrolled in an SQL bootcamp where I am learning the fundamentals of SQL, including how to query databases, filter and sort data, perform aggregations, and write basic joins. This repository contains examples of the SQL queries Iâ€™ve written as part of my learning journey.

This portfolio aims to demonstrate the core SQL concepts I'm mastering through hands-on practice.

Feel free to explore my work, and donâ€™t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or suggestions!

ðŸ“Œ Topics covered so far:
- SELECT statements
- WHERE conditions
- ORDER BY and LIMIT
- Aggregate functions (SUM, COUNT, AVG, etc.)
- GROUP BY
- Basic filtering and comparisons

More to come as I continue to learn!
